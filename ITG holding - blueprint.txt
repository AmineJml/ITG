ITG holding - blueprint:

- User authentication: JWT token will be used.

- Database:

Users, Tasks, categories

I can create a new task and it wont have a category, the same goes fr category, i can create a category but it wont have any task.

Also a task can have multiple categories, and a category can have multiple task
If a user adds a task to a category from the category api, lets say task create an app - category software developemnt. Therefore i after creatigna  categry i will have another api that allows the user to add different tasks in an array.
It will be added in the category table, however during the process no duplicates will exist with the same name and task_id

Users:
- id
- name
- email
- password

Tasks:
- id
- title
- description
- Due date

Category:
- id
- name
- task_id

-------------------------------------------------------------
apis:
1- Register
2- Login

3- createTask
4- listTasks
5- EditTask
6- SearchTask and filterdata (big problemo)

7- categorizeTask
8- createCategory
9- editCategory
10- delteCategory
11- SearchCategories and  filtercategories (same problem :( )
--------------------------------------------------------------
Only Users may access these apis, except register and login will return with a token for authentication purposses

Validation rules will be included inside the api before adding them to data base - no problemo
